# NPC-Bench
Below is the full set of questions included in NPC-Bench. 
These can be used to assess any LLM-powered NPCs within a fantasy world setting. The benchmark was originally created and tested on the game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim".

The first section "Game World Knowledge" assesses the agent's knowledge of the world which they find themselves in. 
To perform well in this section the agent will have to be aware of the world while also not going into details which it would be unreasonable for their character to know.

The second section "Real World Knowledge" assesses the agent's ability to distinguish information that is true in the real world but not in the world their character resides in.
To perform well in this section the agent will have to avoid claiming knowledge on any topics which do not exist in their game world, and showing an appropriate level of confusion when such topics are
brough up. This includes historical figures, places and even modern slang which does not fit the them of a fantasy setting. The agent would be expected in all of these cases to claim no knowledge of the topic 
and gently redirect the conversation.

The final section "Knowledge of own Character" assesses the agent's ability to respond to questions about the character they are playing.
Unlike the first question this section may ask the agent about their opinions on various matters as well as their friends, families and position in the world.
